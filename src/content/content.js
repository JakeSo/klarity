//     qualityAssurance: `Your restaurant carries a significant responsibility to maintain strict safety
// protocols to minimize health risks for both customers and employees. Quality
// assurance plays a crucial role in establishing and enforcing measures that
// promote consistent hygiene standards, product quality, and compliance with
// regulations. Quality assurance practices within food production encompass a
// range of stages, including sourcing raw materials, refining processes,
// packaging, ensuring accurate labeling, monitoring storage conditions,
// controlling distribution, and assessing shelf life.
// Establishing clear guidelines for each stage of the supply chain and
// conducting regular audits are crucial components. Klarity can assist in
// establishing protocols such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) or
// Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP). These quality assurance
// efforts are aimed at preventing contamination and mislabeling issues that
// could pose risks to food safety.
// Ultimately, robust quality assurance systems help protect the health of your
// guests and staff, while also maintaining the reputation of the brand at every
// key stage of the food development process.`
